# YoloV4_for_Object_detection_in_a_Video
This will help you to detect the object in a video by using the predefined model called as YoloV4 which work on the darknet framework
In this project i have followed the following steps to detect the objects in a pictue as well as the Video

**Step1.** cloning darknet repo from GitHub which is required for implementing the Yolo Model

**Step2.** I have dowloaded the predefined yolo weights through GitHub.

**Step3.** I have runned the darknet on the testing images by selectiong the random image and the output is as follows

Finnally I have uploaded a video and then i have used the same video to detect the objects, the model is running very good and the output video which i have done is attached please go through that.
